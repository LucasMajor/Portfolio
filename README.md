## Model-Based Simulations for Turfgrass Irrigation Scheduling

This project was completed by Lucas Major and Logan Gall, and builds off of initial research from USGA study #2021-15-739.

For this project, there are two primary goals. The first goal is to model turf volumetric water 
content (VWC) using data provided from a previous USGA turfgrass irrigation study. Being 
able to predict future VWC allows us to know how a grass may grow and react with upcoming 
weather.

The second goal was to apply these VWC models to create a simple threshold-based irrigation 
management program. This program is designed so that a golf course superintendent 
could easily use it by inputting as few values as needed. This program can be used to forecast 
VWC and help the user decide the best time to irrigate in order to optimize total water usage 
while still maintaining healthy turf grass. 

For more information on the methods, please see the Project Walkthrough and Final Report files in the Docs folder.
